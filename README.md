# 3D Perception Project exercises

This sequence of folders contains supporting exercises of the 3D perception
project.

The scripts/ folder contains object_identifier.py which executes a cloud
cluster extraction from incoming ROS messages. It must be run as an
executable with the following './object_identifier.py' in the commmand line.
This should be run before 'roslaunch sensor_stick robot_spawn.launch' 
in command line. This displays the environment in Gazebo and RViz of a
tabletop scene. 

environment_setup.txt contains the env setup of the computer that the scripts
ran on successfully.
